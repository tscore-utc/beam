# XML Killer Instructions. And R analysis

In the program arguments set the file path to the outputEvents.xml file.
and set the working directory to where you want the output file written.

```
C:\WAV\BEAM\output\special\90\2_18\trial\outputEvents.xml
```

Then unzip the `outputEvents.xml.gz` in git bash. First go to the working
directory where the file is and unzip.

```
c/WAV/BEAM/output/special/90/2_18/trial >

gunzip outputEvents.xml.gz
```

Then run `XMLKiller`

## Now in R
Copy the output file to the R project directory
