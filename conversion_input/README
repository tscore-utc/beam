ReadME for the InputFilesReader


The InputFilesReader.java class (src/main/java/beam/utils/conversion/InputFilesReader.java)
converts ActivitySim output files into BEAM input files.
Initially, this class converted ActivitySim output files into Matsim files. The MatsimConversionTool.scala
was then used to convert the Matsim files into BEAM-ready input files. This new version of InputFilesReader.java
combines the two into a single step.

It also tackles the issue of memory issues. The MatsimConversionTool initially uses the base scala.xml class
to print to a file, but that would load the entire file onto RAM before writing it to a file. We adjusted the
process by creating a new class LargeFileProcessing.java (src/main/java/beam/utils/conversion/LargeFileProcessing.java)
that prints the xml to a file in small chunks, vastly reducing the amount of RAM necessary for large scenarios.

HOW TO USE:
1. In the beam/conversion_input folder
